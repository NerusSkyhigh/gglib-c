# [GG Lib - C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf0AnY9D9gw)
A repository where I store all the small libraries I develop while writing C code. 

Simply add it as a submodule and import what you need. `CMakeLists.txt` is provided to speed up the import process.
```
path/to/your/git/folder> git submodule add https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/gglib-c
```

Feel free to open issues and pull requests if you find bugs or want to suggest interesting features.
